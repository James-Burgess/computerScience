Hi There,

I currently a moveable character on a webpage but I want prevent it from going out of the screen's bounds.
Please could you give me an idea and some basic code on how to approach this problem?

Thanks!

==================

Hi [student],

lets start with the css by setting your overflow property to hidden so the page doesn't overscroll

As far as keeping him from going off the page, your solution of checking his position is correct, 
however, that position is being calcualted from the top left pixel of the image. 
	all we need to do to fix this is take the image dimesions into consideration when calculating the maxium thresholds

I have altered scripts.js to show you what I mean (see line 29)

I have also linted your code for you. please take note of the correct spacing and consistant use of tabs.
