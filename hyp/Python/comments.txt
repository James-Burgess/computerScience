Hi There,

I'm having a bit of an issue with trying to figure out how to exactly implement the class methods so that I may call
 them outside of the class when trying to create a new SMS object.

Thanks!

Hi, [student]

I have created a new file (classes.py) with some helpful hints on how to call methods within classes.

I have also altered your code slightly to fix some of the mistakes I have pointed out in classes.py as well as showing you a direction you can take if you want to achieve the methods you have listed. 

If you need help with the user-input logic, let me know and I will gladly help,

Your mentor,
James
